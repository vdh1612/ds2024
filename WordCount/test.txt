MapReduce is a framework for processing parallelizable problems 
across large datasets using a large number of computers (nodes),
collectively referred to as a cluster (if all nodes are on the 
same local network and use similar hardware) or a grid (if the 
nodes are shared across geographically and administratively distributed 
systems, and use more heterogeneous hardware). Processing can occur 
on data stored either in a filesystem (unstructured) or in a database
(structured). MapReduce can take advantage of the locality of data, 
processing it near the place it is stored in order to minimize communication 
overhead.
